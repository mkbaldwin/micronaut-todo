# micronaut-todo

This is a simple project just to experiment with the new [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io/) framework.
It uses a milestone release of the Micronaut framework.

This code is purely experimental, and is not intended to actually be used other than for learning.

I have also written a simple Angular based [todo-ui](https://github.com/mkbaldwin/todo-ui) project that can be used to exercise the backend functionality.

This project is released under the [MIT](LICENSE.md) license.
