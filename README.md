# micronaut-todo

This is a simple project just to experiment with the new [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io/) framework.
It uses a snapshot release of the framework that must be built from source (at the time this was 
written there aren't builds published to any maven repositories yet). Follow the instructions for Micronaut 
documentation to do this. 

This code is purely experimental, and is not intended to actually be used other than for learning.
